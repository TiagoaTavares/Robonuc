# Bin-picking
My Master Thesis 

Bin-picking with precision using a 3D Sensor and a 1D Laser Sensor

Bin-picking is the name of the technique used by a robot to grasp objects that are randomly disposed inside a box or a pallet.

My purpose with this thesis is to develop a solution for a different process of bin-picking using a 3D sensor to
generate a point cloud of the objects, and a 1D laser sensor to correctly determinate the exact coordinates of 
the grasping point.
